A (slightly) improved version of the sat solver I wrote for my end of year project at swansea university

I plan to rewrite a better version soon though. my original idea was to improve this version but honestly rewriting it seems more viable

NOTHING WORKS Ive written myself into a pointer hell trying to add a propper occurance table, I will have to come back to this and rewrite it at some point.
